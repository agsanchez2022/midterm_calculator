# Midterm Calculator Project

## Project Structure

The project follows a flat modular structure:

app/ contains all calculator logic including the REPL interface, calculation models, operation strategies, configuration management, memento implementation, observers, validation, and exception handling.  
tests/ contains unit and parameterized tests for all major components.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. Create and activate a virtual environment using:

python3 -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Create a .env file in the project root with the following values:

CALCULATOR_MAX_HISTORY_SIZE=100  
CALCULATOR_AUTO_SAVE=true  
CALCULATOR_DEFAULT_ENCODING=utf-8  

Run the application:

python3 main.py  

## REPL Commands

help – display available commands  
history – show calculation history  
clear – clear stored history  
undo – undo the last calculation  
redo – redo the last undone calculation  
save – save history to file  
load – load history from file  
exit – exit the application  

## Testing and Coverage

Run all tests using:

pytest  

Run tests with coverage reporting:

pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing  

GitHub Actions automatically runs all tests on every push and pull request to the main branch and enforces a minimum test coverage threshold.

## Continuous Integration

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs pytest with coverage, and ensures code quality on every commit.

## Notes

Environment variables should not be committed to GitHub. A .env file is required locally to configure application behavior.

This project was developed as part of the IS601 Module 5 Enhanced Calculator Assignment.
